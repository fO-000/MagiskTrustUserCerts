# Magisk Trust User Certs
This module makes all installed user certificates part of the system certificate store, so that they will automatically be used when building the trust chain. This module makes it unnecessary to add the network_security_config property to an application's manifest.

### Installation
1. Install [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445)
2. Zip files `zip -r AlwaysTrustUserCerts.zip ./*` or download zip from releases
3. Install in Magisk
4. Install client certificates through [normal flow](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/articles/1841102-installing-burp-s-ca-certificate-in-an-android-device)
5. Reboot *twice* (First one will copy certificates to module, second reboot mounts them in the correct location)
6. The installed user certificates can now be found in the system store.

### Removing certificates
Certificates are stored in `/data/adb/modules/trustusercerts/system/etc/security/cacerts`. You can remove them from the directory and reboot to remove them.
